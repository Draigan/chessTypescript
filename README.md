# chess


This is the first project I ever built. I built a chess engine from scratch that follows the rules of chess. As my first project, this was very hard. I learned a lot on the way and constantly saw how I could improve. After some time I would look back at the original code I created and realized it wasn't the best way of doing it. I am leaving it that way as an ode to my learning journey. 

current features
1. All pieces move and take correctly.
2. Check.
3. Inability to put yourself into check.
4. While in check, you can only move a piece that would block check.
5. En passant.
6. En passant out of check.
7. Castle was implimented for whites kingside. I havn't gotten around to the others yet.

To do
1. Checkmate detector. 
2. Playable online with a friend.
3. Queenside castling for white and castling for black.
